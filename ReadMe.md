## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd work-order-matcher
python -m venv wo_matcher_env
wo_matcher_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create `.env` file in project root:

```bash
# Required: Anthropic API Key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your_api_key_here

# Required: Google Sheets Configuration  
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id_here
GOOGLE_SHEET_RANGE=Estimates/Invoices Status!A:R

# Optional: Application Settings
EXPECTED_WORK_ORDER_COUNT_DEFAULT=5
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD_DEFAULT=50
```

### 3. Google Sheets Setup

Your Google Sheet should have columns:
- **WO #**: Work order ID (alpha-numeric for special clients)
- **Total**: Dollar amount
- **Location**: Property address or unit number
- **Description**: Work description

### 4. Run Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The app will:
1. ✅ Validate configuration and API access
2. 🔐 Open browser for Google OAuth (first time only)
3. 📊 Load work orders from your sheet
4. 🚀 Launch the GUI interface

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Paste Email Text**: Copy billing email into the large text area
2. **Set Expected Count**: How many work orders you expect to find
3. **Click "Find Matches"**: AI analysis takes 10-30 seconds
4. **Review Results**: Color-coded confidence levels and detailed evidence
5. **Export if Needed**: Save results to CSV for further analysis

### Confidence Levels

- 🟢 **85-100%**: Very High *(auto-accept quality)*
- 🟡 **70-84%**: High *(likely correct)*  
- 🟠 **50-69%**: Medium *(review recommended)*
- 🔴 **Below 50%**: Low *(manual review required)*

### Sample Email Format

```
Our invoice for the work is as follows:
Unit 5966: The concrete sidewalk and drain area was cracked and needed repair
Materials and Labor: $ 3,987.00
Unit 5804: Drywall was repaired, plastered and painted due to a roof leak 
Materials and Labor: $ 350.00
Grand Total: $ 4,337.00
```

## 🧮 Blended Confidence Scoring

The AI uses a weighted scoring system:

### Exact Match Signals (Max 50 points)
- **Exact unit match**: 50 points → "Unit 5996" = "Unit 5996"
- **Exact address match**: 50 points → "5878 Southern Ave" = "5878 Southern Ave"
- **Building identifier**: 45 points → "Building A" = "Building A"
- **Property name match**: 45 points → "New Endeavor" = "New Endeavor Women's Shelter"

### Amount Signals (Additive)
- **Exact amount**: +30 points → $450.00 = $450.00
- **Close amount** (10-15% diff): +20 points → $450 ≈ $425-475  
- **Rough amount** (20-30% diff): +10 points → $450 ≈ $350-550

### Job Type Signals (Additive)
- **Exact job description**: +15 points → "drain backup" = "back up in the unit"
- **Job category match**: +10 points → "plumbing" = "Plumbing There is a back up"
- **General work type**: +5 points → "repair" = "repaired, plastered and painted"

### Location Signals (Additive)
- **Address fragment**: +15 points → "56th St" ≈ "5878 Southern Ave"
- **General area**: +5 points → "SE DC" = "Washington DC 20019"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No matches found"**
- ✅ *Normal if email descriptions don't match work order data*
- Check that work order IDs start with letters (special clients only)
- Verify unit numbers, addresses, and amounts align

**"Authentication failed"**
- Check `.env` file contains valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Ensure Google Sheet is shared with OAuth application
- Try "Tools > Test Connections" menu option

**"Configuration error"**
- Verify `.env` file is in project root
- Check `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` and `GOOGLE_SHEET_RANGE` are correct
- Sheet name must match exactly (e.g., "Estimates/Invoices Status")

### Debug Mode

Set `DEBUG_MODE=true` in `.env` for detailed logging.
